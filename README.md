# reportCardPals
This is a silly TO DO list app where I can hatch eggs for every micro task I do.  It's totally vibe coded, with an intense amount of iteration. It's meant to run locally in your browser, there's no sophisticated save mechanism, maybe someday I will add that.

# Ain't Nothin' In Here
This app makes eggs that hatch after 5 minutes, unless you click on them.
When they hatch, they will be colored and patterned at random from several options.
There's a shiny and an ombre 'rare' effect that will happen, at random, to certain creatures. 
Shiny adds a glow using the accent color, and some sparkles
Ombre does some math to create a gradient using the base color
Colors are separated by unlockable color palettes that open up every 10 tasks (so far)
The critters appear randomly on the blanket (that's supposed to be a blanket surrounded by a wood fence)
When they hatch, at random certain creatures will be selected and given new coordinates which they will carefully wander to.
When they hatch, each creature is ALSO given a name, randomly generated, from a CSV I wrote (not AI!) and had AI translate into objects or whatever.
Names have parts - titles, suffixes, and regular names, with M, F, and NB genders. M & F names can match with equivalently genedered names, plus NB.
Each creature has a color palette, a static randomly generated pattern, the task it is associated with, its name...
OH AND also, when they hatch, they may be anywhere within 30% bigger or smaller than the base size (I think? might be only 15%)
Pupils on some creatures are also randomly placed
The frog can have three different kinds of mouths.
There are buttons to spawn creatures for testing purposes.

The CSVs are drawn by AI under heavy artistic direction from me, but they are still kinda crappy. Still, they work fine enough.
